# lux-colorizer, Lux Syntax Highlight VS Code Extension

`Lux` is a universal system-level test tool written in Erlang/OTP by HÃ¥kan
Mattsson and other contributors. Based on
[expect](http://www.nist.gov/el/msid/expect.cfm)-like pattern, `Lux` offers
simplified syntax, regular expressions support, switching between multiple
concurrent sessions, extensive logging, post mortem analysis, debugging, and
more. Testing with `Lux` can be a part of more valuable processes, like
developing new services for Cisco NSO, CI/CD pipeline testing, troubleshooting,
etc. It is well known for test automation for developing Cisco Network Service
Orchestrator (NSO) with 4500 test cases per run.
